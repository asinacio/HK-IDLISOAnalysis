# TreeConverter

Script to take output from WCSim, and convert it to a text file for input to the main analysis.
Requires WCSim to be correctly setup and included. [Will add full instructions for that later]

To compile: (will change to Makefile later)

First source script to setup WCSim paths, then:
```
source buildTreeConverter.sh
```
_Will aim to replace this with a Makefile once I've figured out how to do that._
